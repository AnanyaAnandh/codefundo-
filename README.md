                                              Idea for codefundo++
The main idea is to use prediction techniques which employ historical data and vulnerablity of the zone to predict the natural calamities. The next phase is to use a neural network model to feed the present data inside. If the prediction holds an alarm in any form, then prevention measures can be taken, to increase the stock of food, which will be stored in warehouses, which are automated and use less human support, so that human resources can be used in more crucial areas. 

The other part of the idea includes deploying a chatbot, so that there is less human intervention and these chatbots can be used to collect data from affected people, including details such as the exact location, the severity of the damage in that particular location and the number of people stranded. The data collected from these chatbots would be very useful for the rescue operations, as there'll be a better track of the areas that needs more supply and the number of people needed to handle that particular area on a rescue mission.
